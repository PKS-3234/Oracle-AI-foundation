This lesson clarifies the relationship between Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL), and introduces the main types of machine learning.

1. Artificial Intelligence (AI)
Definition: The broad concept of creating machines or systems that can perform tasks requiring human intelligence.

Example: A self-driving car navigating traffic, detecting pedestrians, and making safe lane changes.


2. Machine Learning (ML)
Definition: A subset of AI. It is the development of algorithms that enable machines to learn from data and make predictions or decisions.

Example: A spam email filter that learns to identify and move spam based on user actions and email content.

Algorithms: A specific set of rules, mathematical equations, or procedures a machine learning model follows to learn from data.


3. Deep Learning (DL)
Definition: A subfield of ML that uses neural networks with many layers (deep neural networks) to learn complex patterns in data.

Example: Image recognition software that identifies specific objects like cats in photos.

Types of Machine Learning
There are three main types of machine learning algorithms.


1. Supervised Learning
Definition: The algorithm learns from labeled data to make predictions or classifications. The data includes both inputs and the correct output.

How it Works (Training a Model):

An algorithm is trained using a dataset of past examples (e.g., credit card approval history).

The algorithm incrementally updates the model by analyzing the data samples.

Once trained, the model can predict an outcome for new, unseen data.

Example: A credit card company uses a model trained on past approval history to decide whether to approve a new credit card application.


2. Unsupervised Learning
Definition: The algorithm discovers patterns and structures in unlabeled data. The goal is to find hidden insights rather than a specific outcome.

Example:

Retail Marketing: A company analyzes customer data (household size, income) to group similar customers into "clusters" (e.g., "high spenders") for targeted marketing.

Nutritional Analysis: Grouping fruits and vegetables based on their nutritional similarities to gain insights for a balanced diet.


3. Reinforcement Learning
Definition: An agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or punishments for its actions. It is a trial-and-error approach.

Example: A computer program learning to play a game like chess. It receives a "reward" for a good move and a "punishment" for a bad move, and uses this feedback to improve.

Applications: Autonomous driving, robotics.


Deep Learning and Neural Networks
Deep Learning's Purpose: It is particularly effective for tasks where features and rules are difficult to define manually, such as identifying a cat in an image from raw pixels.

Neural Networks: These are the core technology behind deep learning.

They are composed of multiple layers of "neurons" that are interconnected.

Neural networks are often understood as a form of functional approximation, where they estimate a hidden function by learning from known data.

Generative AI
Definition: A subset of machine learning that creates diverse and fresh content (text, audio, images, etc.).

How it Works: Generative AI models, often powered by neural networks, learn patterns from existing data to generate new, original output.

Example: ChatGPT, which generates text-based responses by understanding patterns it has been trained on.
