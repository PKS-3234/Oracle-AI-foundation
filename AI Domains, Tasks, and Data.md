This lesson provides an overview of the three main AI domains and the types of tasks, data, and models associated with each.

1. Language AI
This domain focuses on tasks involving text.

Tasks:

Text-Related AI: Uses text as input to perform tasks like:

Language Detection: Identifying the language of a text.

Entity Extraction: Pulling out specific names, places, or dates.

Key Phrase Extraction: Summarizing the main points of a text.

Translation: Converting text from one language to another.

Generative AI: The model generates new text as output. Examples include:

Text Generation: Writing stories, poems, or articles.

Summarization: Creating a shorter version of a longer text.

Question Answering: Providing a direct answer to a query.

Chatbots: Interacting with users to provide information or services (e.g., ChatGPT).

Data (Text):

Text is sequential (words follow a specific order).

Tokenization: The process of converting words into numerical representations that a model can understand.

Padding: Making all sentences the same length by adding filler values, which is necessary for many models.

Embeddings: A representation that shows how similar words or sentences are by placing them close to each other in a vector space.

Models:

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): Process data sequentially and use a "hidden state" to remember past information.

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM): An advanced type of RNN that can retain context better over long sequences.

Transformers: Process data in parallel and use a "self-attention" mechanism to better understand the context of words in a sentence.

2. Audio and Speech AI
This domain deals with tasks that involve spoken language and other sounds.

Tasks:

Audio-Related AI: Uses audio as input to perform tasks like:

Speech-to-Text Conversion: Transcribing spoken words into written text.

Speaker Recognition: Identifying who is speaking.

Voice Conversion: Changing one person's voice to another's.

Generative AI: The model creates new audio as output. Examples include:

Music Composition: Generating new musical pieces.

Speech Synthesis: Creating artificial speech (text-to-speech).

Data (Audio):

Audio is digitized by taking "snapshots" over time.

Sample Rate: The number of times per second an audio sample is taken (e.g., 44.1 kHz for CDs).

Bit Depth: The amount of information stored in each sample.

Since a single sample is not meaningful, multiple samples are correlated to make sense of the data.

Models:

Many models are similar to those used for language due to the sequential nature of audio.

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTMs), and Transformers are all used.

Other models include Variational Autoencoders, Waveform Models, and Siamese Networks.

3. Vision AI
This domain focuses on tasks involving images and video.

Tasks:

Image-Related AI: Uses an image as input to perform tasks like:

Image Classification: Labeling an entire image (e.g., "this is a cat").

Object Detection: Identifying and locating specific objects within an image.

Facial Recognition: Identifying individuals from images or video, often used for security.

Generative AI: The model generates new images or visual content. Examples include:

Image Generation from Text: Creating an image from a text description (e.g., "a dog wearing a hat").

Image Style Transfer: Applying the style of one image to another.

3D Model Generation: Creating realistic 3D models of objects or scenes.

Data (Images):

Images are made up of pixels, which can be grayscale or color.

A single pixel is not informative; a group of pixels is needed to understand the image.

Models:

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): A key model for computer vision that detects patterns and learns hierarchical features in images.

YOLO (You Only Look Once): A popular model specifically for real-time object detection.

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs): Used to generate new, realistic images.

4. Other AI Tasks
The lesson also briefly mentions other important AI applications:

Anomaly Detection: Used to find unusual data points in time-series data (e.g., fraud detection, machine failures).

Recommendation Systems: Suggests products or content to users based on their preferences or the behavior of similar users.

Forecasting: Uses time-series data to predict future events (e.g., weather forecasting, stock prices).
